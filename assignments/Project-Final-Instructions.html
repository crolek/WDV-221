    <h1>Project - Final Instructions</h1>

    <h2>Overall Instructions</h2>
    <p>
        Do this project in parts. Work on one part at a time, make sure you meet the criteria around it, and then add the next part.
    </p>

    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <p>
        The first part you will be creating a manual image slide show. The slide show component will start with 1 of 3 images on the page.<br />
        Example images are below, but you can use any images you'd like. (You have to use at least 3 images to start.)
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>https://crolek.github.io/WDV-221/assignments/imgs/final/garden.jpg</li>
        <li>https://crolek.github.io/WDV-221/assignments/imgs/final/stewie.jpg</li>

    </ul>
    <p>
        These goal of this part is to rotate through each image in order.
        When the user clicks the Next button it should switch-out or hide the current image and show the next image.
        If the final image is displayed, and the user clicks the Next button it should show the first element in the list.
        This same concept applies applied to the Previous button, but respectively going in reverse.
    </p>

    <h2>Part 2</h2>
    <p>
        In this part you will be adding the ability to add a new image to the list. Treat the value that is added to the "New Image" field as a URL.
        An example of an image URL that might get added is this:<br />
        http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/554344612832092160/WRLmixCH_400x400.png<br />
    </p>

    <h2>Part 3</h2>
    <p>
        Add validation to the "New Image" field that makes sure the feild isn't empty. If it is empty then display an error.
    </p>
