    <h1>Project - Forms Instructions</h1>

    <p>The goal of this project is to learn how to validate a form with plain JS.</p>
    <p><a href="http://crolek.github.io/WDV-221/assignments/Project-Forms-Template.html">I created an HTML form for you to use to complete this project.</a></p>

    <p>The form <strong>does not have to Submit to any location.</strong> It just needs to console.log() the resulting data.</p>
    <p>The result object that you console.log() should be structured like: </p>
    <pre>
    {
        "firstName": "Stewie",
        "email": "lilsquiggle@gmail.com",
        "message": "Something goes here",
        "gender": "male"
    }
    </pre>
    <p>The exact keys of "firstName", "email", "message", and "gender" have to be used for the object that you console.log().</p>

    <p>
        There are 4 different input types on the page and each needs to be validated before the form can "submit" (aka, console.log() the results).
        You can validate the individual fields on a blur event, or all at once when the user clicks the "submit" button.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the field is not valid (like the First Name field) you should display an appropriate message in the error-box.
        The message could be "First Name field is incorrect, it can only have letters.". You must have <strong>an unique error
        message per field.</strong> <br />
        The error messages should go in the div with the class of "error-box".
        <br />
        Error messages should disappear when the field becomes a valid field.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Hint:<br /></strong>
        You will have to use the event.preventDefault() function inside your event handler to complete this project.
        Reference the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault">preventDefault api.</a>
    </p>
